# 🩺 MediScan: AI-Powered Disease Prediction System

> An interactive medical chatbot that predicts diseases from symptoms using **machine learning** and provides **descriptions & precautionary measures**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Symptom-Based Prediction**: Enter your symptoms (comma-separated) and get the most likely disease.  
- ✅ **Disease Information**: Fetch disease descriptions, symptoms, and recommended precautions.  
- ✅ **Dual Interface**:
  - **Command Line (CLI)** via `medbot.py`  
  - **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** via `frontline.py` (Tkinter)  
- ✅ **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)  
  - Random Forest  
- ✅ **Majority Voting System** for robust predictions.
